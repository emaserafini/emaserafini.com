Google.com was down for a few minutes between 23:52 and 23:57 BST on Aug 16, 2013. This result of this downtime was a massive drop in global internet traffic.

[GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com/r/ODU5MTM4) a service providing real-time analytics for websites reported a __40% drop__ in the number of pageviews. That's a massive drop for only a few seconds downtime and highlights just how much we rely on Google as internet users.

Google has not yet released a statement regarding the outage but I'm sure who ever tripped over the plug socket has gone into hiding and [John McClane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/) can put away his vestâ€¦ for now.
